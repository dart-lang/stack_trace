/// A stack chain is a collection of one or more stack traces that collectively
/// represent the path from [main] through nested function calls to a particular
/// code location, usually where an error was thrown. Multiple stack traces are
/// necessary when using asynchronous functions, since the program's stack is
/// reset before each asynchronous callback is run.
///
/// Stack chains can be automatically tracked using [Chain.capture]. This sets
/// up a new [Zone] in which the current stack chain is tracked and can be
/// accessed using [new Chain.current]. Any errors that would be top-leveled in
/// the zone can be handled, along with their associated chains, with the
/// `onError` callback. For example:
///
///     Chain.capture(() {
///       // ...
///     }, onError: (error, stackChain) {
///       print("Caught error $error\n"
///             "$stackChain");
