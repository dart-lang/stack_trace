# TODO(rnystrom): The version should be 2.0.0-dev, but doing so causes pub get
# to fail since this depends on test, which has a cyclic dependency back onto
# stack_trace. There are no versions of test that support stack_trace 2.0.0
# yet.
version: 1.10.0-dev
# TODO(rnystrom): Remove this line once the above version issue is fixed.
